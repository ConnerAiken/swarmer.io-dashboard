It uses e2e (end to end) tests, also known as UI tests, to load test your web application. Easily import phantomjs, casperjs, webdriver.io and nightwatchjs tests to build user behavior tasks then test the experience at 25, 50, 100 even 1000+ users. Free to try and very affordable unlike most UI testing services. No software to install, just type in your website address and define some simple actions. Detailed reports are available for download after tests conclude. Track and monitor your load balancer and  server configuration optimizations easily and automatically."> <meta name=Keywords content="load test, load, testing, tester, load tester, online load tester, load testing with protractor, load testing with jest, load testing with jasmine, load testing with mocha, load testing web apps, web app, web app testing"> <script src=https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js></script> <style>#app{display:none}</style> </head> <body> <div id=app></div> <script type="text/javascript" src="/bundle.js"></script></body> </html>
